I am just testing my git accoount.
I am trying to learn git.]
I learn what is Git and Github.
Git is a version control and "collaboration" i.e., it keep track of history of my project and many people work together in the same project. That means it is a version control software.
Github is a web service or webserver means code run in the background.

Term associated with Github is "Repository" or "Repo" means we create a new project files here .
 "commit" meands save and after that each commit has a hash code.
 
 we are in the middle and we want to learn the git concept through github interface and later see how the concept locally transfer to my computer.
